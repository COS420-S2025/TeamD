### Problem Statement
1. Many consumers lose track of the current inventory on their fridge shelves. 

2. For example, a person might purchase a second gallon of milk or a jar of salsa because they cannot remember what is in their fridge, causing them to spend money on food that they already own. 

3. Traditional grocery lists are a common tool for planning what to buy, allowing consumers to write down specific items before they head to the grocery store. 

4. But they are fundamentally flawed because they only focus on the purchase of new items and don't track the items already bought. 

5. How can we design an accessible tool that helps people manage their food inventory effectively to help avoid repetitive purchases and promote better household spending?
