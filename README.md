### Problem Statement
#### Draft 1: Financial Drain of Redundant Purchases
Many consumers lose track of the current inventory on their fridge shelves. For example, a person might purchase a second gallon of milk or a jar of salsa because they cannot remember what is in their fridge, causing them to spend money on food that they already own. Traditional grocery lists are a common tool for planning what to buy, allowing consumers to write down specific items before they head to the grocery store. But they are fundamentally flawed because they only focus on the purchase of new items and don't track the items already bought. How can we design a tool to help people not make repetitive purchases and prevent loss of money by providing real-time inventory of a household’s existing food supply?

#### Draft 2: Food Waste
Losing track of your refrigerator contents leads to significant food waste when items expire. For example, produce often gets pushed to the back or put into drawers and forgotten about until it spoils or duplicate food goes bad before both can be used. Smart fridges with internal cameras and sensors, address the need for inventory visibility, by allowing users to look inside their refrigerators without opening the doors. But this doesn’t address the cause of food waste because this is an inefficient option and not accessible for the average consumer. How can we design an accessible tool that helps people manage their food inventory effectively to promote food consumption rather than wasted food?
